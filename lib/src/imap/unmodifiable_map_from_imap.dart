/// The [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap] is a relatively safe, unmodifiable [Map] that is built from an
/// [IMap] or another [Map]. The construction of the [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap] is very fast,
/// since it makes no copies of the given map items, but just uses it directly.
///
/// If you try to use methods that modify the [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap], like [add],
/// it will throw an [UnsupportedError].
///
/// If you create it from an [IMap], it is also very fast to lock the [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap]
/// back into an [IMap].
///
/// <br>
///
/// ## How does it compare to Dart's native [Map.unmodifiable] and [UnmodifiableMapView]?
///
/// [Map.unmodifiable] is slow, but it's always safe, because *it is not a view*, and
/// actually creates a new map. On the other hand, [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap] and
/// [UnmodifiableMapView] are fast, but if you create them from a regular [Map] and then modify
/// that original [Map], you will also be modifying the views. Also note, if you create an
/// [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap] from an [IMap], then it's totally safe , then it's totally safe
/// because the original [IMap] can't be modified.
///
/// The only different between an [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap] and an [UnmodifiableMapView] is that
/// [UnmodifiableMapFromIMap] accepts both a [Map] and an [IMap].
///
/// See also: [ModifiableMapFromIMap]
